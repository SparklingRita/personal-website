# ✨ Personal Website using React and Vite
Check it out live 👉[ritacmendes.com](https://www.ritacmendes.com)!

This website serves as my personal hub, a place to showcase my fun side projects, experiments and creative ideas.

**Disclaimer:** It's still a work in progress, especially regarding responsiveness across all screen sizes (bear with me :')).

## 🌈 Rainbow Button
Try it out in the Navbar!

I couldn't decide on a background color, so I made it interactive: using a color picker slider component from [`react-color` library](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/), users can pick their own background shade.
There is also a function that dynamically shifts the hue to create a subtle gradient effect.

## 📄 CV Page
This page is entirely rendered using HTML, and dynamically populated from a single `.js` file that keeps all information organized and easy to maintain.


For the Download PDF feature, I used the [`react-pdf` library](https://react-pdf.org/). This allows the same structured `.js` data into an interactive, downloadable PDF.
